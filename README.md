# Spotify Music Suggestion Model

## Description
This project is part of the coursework for CSE 144, an Applied Machine Learning class at the University of California, Santa Cruz, during the Spring 2024 quarter. Our objective is to develop a Spotify music suggestion model using a multimodal fusion-based attentive network that leverages multiple modalities, including tags, lyrics, and acoustic content of songs.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
`git clone git@github.com:Ernesto2004/spotify_music_suggestion.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory and **install the required dependencies**:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. **Create a folder** named `misc` in the project directory. This folder will be used to store the dataset.

4. **Download the dataset** from the following link: [Dataset Download Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undefinenull/million-song-dataset-spotify-lastfm?select=User+Listening+History.csv)

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is stored in the `misc` folder. It contains the necessary data for training and evaluating the Spotify music suggestion model.

## Dependencies
The project relies on various Python libraries for data processing, model training, and evaluation. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using pip.
